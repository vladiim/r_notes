# This list wouldn't be complete without including at least one machine learning package you can impress your friends with. Random Forest is a great algorithm to start with. It's easy to use, can do supervised or unsupervised learning, it can be used with many differnet types of datasets, but most importantly it's effective! Here's how it works in R.

# download Titanic Survivors data
data <- read.table("http://math.ucdenver.edu/RTutorial/titanic.txt", h=T, sep="\t")
# make survived into a yes/no

# split into a training and test set
idx <- runif(nrow(data)) <= .75
data.train <- data[idx,]
data.test <- data[-idx,]
 
# train a random forest
rf <- randomForest(Survived ~ PClass + Age + Sex,
